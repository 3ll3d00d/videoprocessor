0.1.1
- Figured out why my keyboard commands were not working, madVR has anti-debugging protection which triggers when running inside
  of MSVC debugger. That also disables the keyboard shortcuts. They just worked. Cleaned up the code to remove the needless paths.
- Now has the /fullscreen command line option which can be given. As soon as the program detects a renderable input it'll change to
  fullscreen mode
- Enable/disable buttons based on presence of renderer
- Fix: Error upon switching capture card input which remembers old state
- Fix: GUI elements & state related to capture device were uninitialized at start and not cleared when restarting capture

0.1.0
- Full screen now works and remains full even when modeswitching. 
  Will full-screen to current monitor. 
  Toggle with alt-enter, exit with escape.
- Tested with madVR beta 132

0.0.4
- Overridable DirectShow inputs to madVR

0.0.3
- If the renderer throws this is now shown in the GUI and properly handled.
- You can actually get out of full-screen with alt-f4

0.0.2
- Fix for SDR handling which would stop the renderer
- In renderer stops with a failure it will now be restarted by either pressing the restart button or when a new mode comes along

0.0.1
- First release, very very alpha, will blow up, probably eats your homework - be warned!
- Known issue: can't return from full screen mode
- Known issue: Only supports BlackMagic cards and only support v210 input
