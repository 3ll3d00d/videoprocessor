Roadmap
=======

0.3.0: Clocks
- Change display modes to be real frame interval and display interval
- Cleanup TODOs
- Fix exit hang
- Fix memory leaks

0.3.1: GUI
- Remove mouse pointer after going full screen
- Add context information to all throws

0.4.0: DVD
- Support for interlaced formats (aim to support DVD, will only test with PS4Pro as player)

0.5.0: Website
- Help page linked to help-buttons in GUI
- Website: Go live with a page
- Website: Tutorial on how to install VideoProcessor and madVR
- Update readme to reflect info on website

1.0.0: Out of beta
- No changes expected, re-release of 0.5.0 code

1.1.0: Audio and delay
- Audio
- Determine baseline latency with external meter
- Investigate configurable aimed-for delay to ensure external lip-sync is spot on
- Website: Tutorial on how to measure frame-delay with a meter, set correct delay in VideoProcessor, setup delay in external AV unit
- Configurable delay to guarantee buffering for madvr

1.2.0: Zoom
- Cropping-zoom so that at a certain amount of crop madVR starts to remove the remaining black bars (steppi85)

Ideas for later:
- CaptureInput as a first-class citizen rather than a POD (rename to capture device input?)
- Tutorial on how to do a 3d LUT
- Toggelable HDCP on video output through the win32 Output Protection Manager
  (This will lead to problems with NVIDIA GRID as it's not allowed to capture)
- Only force settings if none are present (LLDV case mcpherv). Looked at this and it seems little useful without further scripting
  or the ability to store config. Both are not yet on the radar.
- Use NVIDIA GRID to get the rendered frame and get the egress timestamp it so that we can build a feedback system going.
  This actually seems possible to get us timestamps of point of frame-render. If the egress delay from there is reasonably
  constant we can probably get a near constant-time renderer going.
