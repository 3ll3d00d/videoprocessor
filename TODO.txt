Roadmap

0.1.2
- Only force settings if none are present (LLDV case mcpherv)

0.1.3
- Convert RGB formats which madVR cannot handle natively
  - r210 coming out of the Blackmagic card (10 bit RGB)
  - whatever the psp4pro does in terms of HDR output from games which seems some 12-bit RGB.

0.2.0
- Timing improvements
  - Use hardware timestamps from capture card for frame timing in directshow

0.2.1
  - Determine baseline latency with external meter
  - Investigate truely constant rendering times so audio can be in sync with fixed offset in remote audio device
  - Use NVIDIA GRID to get the rendered frame and get the egress timestamp it so that we can build a feedback system going.
    This actually seems possible to get us timestamps of point of frame-render. If the egress delay from there is reasonably
	constant we can probably get a near constant-time renderer going.

Later
- Audio
  - Directshow rendered
- Toggelable HDCP on video output through the win32 Output Protection Manager
  (This will lead to problems with NVIDIA GRID as it's not allowed to capture, and hence we can't get RTT if this is enabled)
- Support for interlaced formats (only the ones which madVR can handle)
- CaptureInput as a first-class citizen rather than a POD (rename to capture device input?)
- Cropping-zoom so that at a certain amount of crop madVR starts to remove the remaining black bars (steppi85)
