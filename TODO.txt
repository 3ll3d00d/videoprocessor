Roadmap
=======

0.4.0: Upscaling
- Change display modes to be real frame interval and display interval
- Change pixelformat to be something between that and an encoding format?
- Add support for interlaced formats (but no testing or further plumbing)
- Optionally force YCbCr422 to YCbCr420 so that the renderer can do the upscaling

1.0.0: Out of beta
- No changes expected, re-release of 0.4.0 code

1.1.0: Audio and delay
- Audio
- Determine baseline latency with external meter
- Investigate configurable aimed-for delay to ensure external lip-sync is spot on

1.2.0: Zoom
- Cropping-zoom in y and x dimensions
- Auto shifting (hwf)

Stuff & ideas to do for later:
- Integrate MPV renderer (that would be a non-DirectShow renderer, so quite some plumbing required)
- CaptureInput as a first-class citizen rather than a POD (rename to capture device input?)
- Toggelable HDCP on video output through the win32 Output Protection Manager
  (This will lead to problems with NVIDIA GRID as it's not allowed to capture)
- Only force settings if none are present (LLDV case mcpherv). Looked at this and it seems little useful without further scripting
  or the ability to store config. Both are not yet on the radar.
- Use NVIDIA GRID to get the rendered frame and get the egress timestamp it so that we can build a feedback system going.
  This actually seems possible to get us timestamps of point of frame-render. If the egress delay from there is reasonably
  constant we can probably get a near constant-time renderer going.
- Build a git version to version.rc generator and use that to set VS_VERSION_INFO version etc
- Make group names clickable and open help page
- Add menu bar with help link
- Support for interlaced modes (don't have hardware which does this)
- If the blackmagic capture thread throws that's never shown a new one is spun up silently, try-catch external calls, make errors visible
- If the CAM thread throws that's never shown, make errors visible
- Replace GDI drawing with MFC
- Clean up all TODOs

Can't fix:
- DeckLink cannot handle 12bit YUV
- DeckLink forces YUV 444 to 422
