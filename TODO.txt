TODO:
- Recognition of monitors, be able to direct full-screen to a specific one
  - Forward key presses and mouse to renderer even in full-screen
  - Alt-enter entry/exit of full screen mode
- if the renderer fails to start throw a nice error message and ensure it doesn't try to keep on starting
- Convert RGB formats which madVR cannot handle natively
  - r210 coming out of the Blackmagic card (10 bit RGB)
- Timing improvements
  - Use hardware timestamps from capture card for frame timing
  - Determine baseline latency with external meter
  - Investigate truely constant rendering times so audio can be in sync with fixed offset in remote audio device
  - See if we can get the egress timestamp from the nvidia so we can build a feedback system gogin
- Audio
  - Directshow rendered
  - Passthrough high end audio (see what's supported)
- Support for interlaced formats (only the ones which madVR can handle)
- Toggelable HDCP on video output through the win32 Output Protection Manager
- CaptureInput as a first-class citizen rather than a POD (rename to capture device input?)
