High:
- once in fullscreen can't exit
- if the renderer fails to start throw a nice error message and ensure it doesn't try to keep on starting

Later:
- support r210 coming out of the Blackmagic card (10 bit RGB, but this format is not supported by madVR so needs conversion)
- use hardware timestamps from capture card for frame timing
- interlaced formats
- CaptureInput as a first-class citizen rather than a POD (rename to capture device input?)
- support audio

Probably never:
- Capture bits should be DirectShow source filters so that they are also usable in other programs. These other programs then also need to implement 
  custom interfaces to (re-) build graphs on demand and use the extracted metadata in the right way.
